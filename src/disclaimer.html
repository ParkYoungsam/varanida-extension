<h2>Regulatory uncertainties of tokens</h2>
<p>The regulatory status of tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology. It is difficult to predict how or whether the regulator may implement changes to the law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the VAD Tokens and the Varanida Protocol. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the functionalities of the VAD Tokens and Varanida Protocol in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, though a determination that the purchases, sale and delivery of the VAD Tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that the VAD Token is a regulated instrument that requires registration, or the licensing of some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Varanida Protocol will not be used and may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event where that regulatory actions, or changes to low or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b>A VAD Token is not a financial instrument</b></p>
<p>A VAD Token does not represent an investment in a security or a financial instrument within the meaning of EU Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 relating to markets in financial instruments: the VAD Token confers no direct or indirect right to Varanida's capital or income, nor does it confer any governance right within Varanida.<p>
<p><b>A VAD Token is not proof of ownership or a right of control</b></p>
<p>It does not confer any right on any asset or share in Varanida. A VAD Token does not grant any right to participate in control over Varanida's management or decision-making set-up.</p>
<p><b>A VAD Token is not an electronic currency</b> within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to access to and pursuit of the business of electronic currency institutions: VAD Token does not have a fixed exchange value equal to the amount delivered at the time of its issue.</p>
<p><b>A VAD Token does not qualify as a payment service</b> within the meaning of EU Directive (2007/64/EC) of 13 November 2007 relating to payment services in the internal market, nor within the meaning of the (EU) Directive relating to payment services 2 (DSP 2) N° 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015: the Crowdsale does not involve the purchase/sale of VAD Tokens and the Varanida’s business does not consist in receiving currencies against the delivery of VAD Token; as such, a VAD Token is not a means of payment either.</p>
<p><b>A VAD Token is a cryptographic token used through the Varanida protocol.</b>
A VAD Token is a crypto-currency, i.e. an unregulated, digital asset, issued and controlled by its developers, and used and accepted only by the members of a given community.</p>
<h2>Intellectual property belonging to Varanida</h2>

<h2>Protection of Personal Data</h2>
<p>The processing of personal data performed under the Crowdsale will be provided in France to the National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties upon request.

<h2>Regulatory uncertainties</h2>
<p>The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that the Crowdsale launched by Varanida is taking place within a French legal environment that is still under development. New laws or rules may subsequently frame, modify or clarify the practice of such Crowdsale. Where necessary, should legislative changes conflict with all or part of these terms and conditions, Varanida reserves the right to amend the terms of the Crowdsale as appropriate, retroactively if necessary, in order to ensure that the Crowdsale remains legal and compliant with the various French regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>Varanida will respond to any request issued via regular legal process aimed at obtaining specific information about the Purchasers, particularly in terms of the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p>Purchasers of VAD Tokens must seek appropriate financial, tax and other legal and regulatory advice from independent financial advisors with appropriate qualifications to determine whether the purchase of the VAD Tokens is adapted to their own situation and authorised for subscription under their own legal and regulatory rules. Any decision to purchase the VAD Tokens should be based on the information contained in the White Paper and the Terms & Conditions which includes, inter alia, information on certain risks associated with the purchase of the VAD Tokens (Investors shall paid attention to the Section “Risk” of the T&C to assess the risk linked to the purchasing of the VAD Tokens).</p>
<h2>Applicable law and jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These T&C and any contract relationship relating to the Protocol set-up by Varanida are governed exclusively by French law, the Varanida's commitment being subject to this clause.
Varanida and the Purchasers agree to seek an amicable settlement prior to bringing any legal action. Failing this, any dispute, of any nature whatsoever, will be brought expressly before the court with jurisdiction over the Varanida's registered headquarters, as no document can affect a novation or waiver of this jurisdiction clause.</p>
